school assignment

A program that "learns" by asking the user questions presents a fundamental problem
creation of artificial intelligence. The program uses binary as its main data structure
decision tree (binary decision tree). The nodes (nodes) of the tree having children contain vo
of your data part of the "yes/no" question. The user thinks of some object and based on it
the characteristic answers the questions of the program.
At the beginning of the activity, the program asks a question located in the data part of the root node
tree. If the user answers no/yes, the program moves to the left/right child
of the root node and asks a question in its data part.
This process is repeated and the program moves down the decision tree until
completes to the "leaf" node (leaf node). "Leaf" nodes have no children in the data part
they bear the name of the object corresponding to the sequence of the user's responses.
When the program reaches a "leaf" node, it does not ask a question, but outputs the resulting object. if
the object matches the intended object of the user, the program "proved its intelligence". if
objects differ, the program develops its knowledge base by expanding its
decision tree. Asks the user to enter the intended object and "yes/no"
question that allows distinguishing the user object from the program object. The program subsequently
he places this question in the appropriate place in his decision tree.
As the number of "games" increases, so does the program's ability to recognize different ones
objects.
